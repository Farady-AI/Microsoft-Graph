# Current Development Context

## Project Overview
- FastAPI backend service deployed on Render (https://microsoft-graph-2.onrender.com)
- Service intended to support a Custom GPT for K-12 PE, Health, and Driver's Ed teachers in Elizabeth Public Schools (EPS)
- Repository: https://github.com/Farady-AI/Microsoft-Graph.git

## Recent Changes
1. Added new endpoints:
   - `/test` (POST) - Simple health check endpoint
   - `/generate-document` (POST) - Simplified document generation
2. Added CORS support
3. Simplified document generation logic
4. Restored `TextRequest` class definition after deployment error

## Current Status
1. Code has been pushed to GitHub (latest commit: 0e419fe - "Fix: Restored TextRequest class definition")
2. Manual deployment on Render was triggered
3. Service shows as "live" but endpoints are returning 404s

## Current Issue
Despite successful code push and Render deployment, the new endpoints are not accessible:
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Method POST -Uri "https://microsoft-graph-2.onrender.com/test"
# Returns 404 Not Found
```

## Last Actions Taken
1. Fixed `TextRequest` class definition issue
2. Pushed changes to GitHub
3. Triggered manual deployment on Render
4. Attempted to test endpoints (received 404s)

## Next Steps to Try
1. Verify Render deployment logs for any hidden errors
2. Check if the FastAPI application is properly loading all routes
3. Test the original endpoints (e.g., `/auth/login`) to verify basic functionality
4. Consider checking FastAPI's automatic documentation at `/docs` to see available endpoints
5. Verify environment variables are properly set in Render

## Important Files
1. `main.py` - Contains all endpoints and core logic
2. `render.yaml` - Deployment configuration
3. `.env` - Environment variables (make sure these are set in Render's dashboard)

## Repository Status
- Main branch is up to date with origin
- Latest changes are committed and pushed
- GitHub authentication is confirmed working

## Render Configuration
- Service Name: microsoft-graph-2
- Deploy Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Start Command: `gunicorn -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker -b 0.0.0.0:8000 main:app`

## To Continue Development
1. Check Render deployment logs for any errors
2. Verify the application is starting correctly
3. Consider adding more logging to track route registration
4. Test both new and existing endpoints to isolate the issue

## Testing Commands
```powershell
# Test basic endpoint
Invoke-WebRequest -Method POST -Uri "https://microsoft-graph-2.onrender.com/test"

# Test document generation
$body = @{
    document_type = "lesson_plan"
    title = "Test Lesson Plan"
    content = "This is a test content."
    output_format = "docx"
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-WebRequest -Method POST -Uri "https://microsoft-graph-2.onrender.com/generate-document" -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
```
